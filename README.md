Obspy read support for Fairfield Nodal Receiver Gather format 1.6-1

Quickstart
---------

I will be working on integrating this into obspy, but it wont hit at least
until April 2018. Until then, just pip install this package using its git url
and obspy should be able to read the rg1.6 format.

```bash
>>> pip install git+https://github.com/d-chambers/rg16
```
